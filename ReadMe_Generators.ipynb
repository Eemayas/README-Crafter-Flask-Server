It has two main methods: `_drawWithRoundedCorners` and `_drawWithSquareCorners`, which draw the actual indentation shape.\\n\\n**Drawing Methods**\\n\\nThere are two drawing methods, each with an optional `drawBottom` parameter:\\n\\n1. `_drawWithRoundedCorners`: draws a rounded corner rectangle.\\n2. `_drawWithSquareCorners`: draws a square-edged rectangle.\\n\\nBoth methods take several parameters, including:\\n\\t* `canvas`: the painting canvas\\n\\t* `paint`: the paint used to draw the shape\\n\\t* `strokeWidth`: the width of the shape's outline\\n\\t* `center`, `topOrigin`, `cornerOuter`, `cornerInner`, `end`, and `bottom`: various points that define the shape\\n\\n**Helper Method**\\n\\nThere is a helper method `_drawScopingLines` that draws scoping lines for the indentation. It takes several parameters, including:\\n\\t* `canvas`: the painting canvas\\n\\t* `origin`: the top-left corner of the scoping line\\n\\t* `bottom`: the bottom edge of the scoping line\\n\\t* `node`: the tree node being painted\\n\\t* `paint`: the paint used to draw the scoping lines\\n\\n**Should Repaint**\\n\\nThe `_IndentationPainter` class overrides the `shouldRepaint` method, which is called when the widget needs to be repainted. In this case, it returns true if either the indentation or the node being painted has changed.\\n\\n**Other**\\n\\nThere are some other methods and variables used in the code, but they are mostly helper functions for `_drawWithRoundedCorners`, `_drawWithSquareCorners`, and `_drawScopingLines`. The main functionality is contained within these three drawing methods.\", metadata=None)                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

The tree is built from an array of `(TreeNode, List<TreeNode>)` objects, which represent different stages of a dynamic tree. The class has a state variable `stateCount`, which keeps track of the current stage in the array. A button labeled \"Next\" is used to switch between the different stages.\\n\\n**Helper Functions**\\n\\nThe code also defines several helper functions for creating and manipulating `TreeNode` objects, including `defaultTree`, `longTree`, `nodesAddedTree`, and `nodesRemovedTree`.\\n\\nOverall, the code provides a basic framework for building and displaying complex tree views in Flutter applications.', metadata=None)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",
