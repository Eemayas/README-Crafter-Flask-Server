# Project Overview

The Animated Tree View project aims to provide a framework for building complex tree views in Flutter applications, offering both stateless and stateful variants to cater to different use cases. This project provides a set of classes and helper functions that can be used to create and display animated tree views with multiple nodes and buttons for navigation.

The project does this by extending the `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` class, depending on whether it's a stateless or stateful variant. The FakeStatelessTreeView displays a simple tree view with a root node, while the FakeStatefulTreeView shows a more complex tree view with multiple nodes and buttons for navigating through the tree. These classes take an array of (TreeNode, List<TreeNode>) objects to represent different stages of a dynamic tree, allowing users to switch between these stages using a "Next" button. Additionally, helper functions are provided to create and manipulate TreeNode objects, such as defaultTree, longTree, nodesAddedTree, and nodesRemovedTree.

The project uses Flutter as its development framework, utilizing the animated_tree_view package for building complex tree views. The key features of this project include the ability to build both simple and complex tree views, navigate between different stages of a dynamic tree, and create TreeNode objects using various helper functions.

# Key Features
- **Stateless Tree View**: Displays a simple tree view with a root node.
- **Stateful Dynamic Tree View**: Displays a complex tree view with multiple nodes, buttons for navigation, and dynamic stages.
- **TreeNode Class**: Represents individual nodes in the tree view, which can be created programmatically or loaded from an external source.
- **Tree Node Testing Functions**: Three testing functions to verify the rendering and visibility of tree nodes.
- **Animated Tree View Widget**: Provides a basic framework for building and displaying complex tree views in Flutter applications.

=====================================

## Getting Started
---------------

This guide will walk you through installing and running the Animated Tree View project.

### Prerequisites
--------------

* Dart SDK (download from [official website](https://dart.dev/get-dart))
* Flutter SDK (download from [official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install))
* Git (download from [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

## Setup Instructions
---------------------

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the Animated Tree View repository from GitHub using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/embraceitmobile/animated_tree_view.git
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install dependencies:
```bash
dart pub get
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (optional)

If you're planning to modify the code, it's a good idea to configure your environment variables. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` file or equivalent:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/flutter/bin
export DART_SDK=/path/to/dart/sdk
```
Replace `/path/to/flutter/bin` and `/path/to/dart/sdk` with the actual paths to your Flutter and Dart SDKs.

### Step 4: Build the Project

Run the following command to build the project:
```bash
flutter pub run flutter_build_runner build
dartanalyzer .
```

## Running the Project
---------------------

### Step 1: Create a New Flutter Project

Create a new Flutter project using the following command:
```bash
flutter create my_animated_tree_view_project
```
Replace `my_animated_tree_view_project` with your desired project name.

### Step 2: Copy the Animated Tree View Code

Copy the entire contents of the cloned repository into your newly created project directory, replacing the default code provided by Flutter.

### Step 3: Run the Project

Run the project using the following command:
```bash
flutter run -d emulator_name
```
Replace `emulator_name` with the actual name of your emulator.

## Tests
-----

To run tests, navigate to the `test/` directory and run the following commands:

### Listenable Node Tests
------------------------

* Run listenable node tests: `dart test listenable_node/`
* Run individual test files (e.g., `listenable_indexed_node_test.dart`): `dart test listenable_node/listenable_indexed_node_test.dart`

### Indexed Node Tests
-----------------------

* Run indexed node tests: `dart test node/indexed_node_test.dart`
* Run individual test files (e.g., `indexed_node_mocks.dart`): `dart test node/indexed_node_mocks.dart`

## Troubleshooting
-----------------

### Issue 1: Missing Dependencies

If you encounter issues with missing dependencies, try running:
```bash
dart pub get
flutter pub get
```
and then rebuild the project using `flutter build`.

### Issue 2: Failed Builds

If builds fail due to errors in generated files (e.g., `.g.dart`), try deleting the `build/` directory and rebuilding.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install and run the Animated Tree View project. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask!

# API Reference
This is an Xcode project file (`.xcodeproj` file) in the format of a Property List (`.plist` file). It contains configuration settings for building and running an iOS application written in Swift.

Here are some key elements extracted from this file:

1. **Build Settings**: The `buildSettings` dictionary defines various build-time options, such as:
	* `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME`: Sets the name of the asset catalog to use when compiling app icons.
	* `CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES`: Enables or disables module maps for Swift code.
	* `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`: Sets the current project version (e.g., a build number).
	* `ENABLE_BITCODE`: Disables bitcode generation, which can improve performance but makes it harder to debug issues.
	* `INFOPLIST_FILE`: Specifies the Info.plist file to use when building the app.
2. **Target Configurations**: The `.xcconfig` files referenced in this project define target-specific build settings:
	* `Debug.xcconfig`: Defines build settings for a Debug configuration, such as enabling module maps and setting the Swift optimization level to `-Onone`.
	* `Release.xcconfig`: Defines build settings for a Release configuration, which is similar to the Debug configuration but with some differences (e.g., disabling module maps).
3. **Build Configuration Lists**: These XCConfigurationList objects define lists of build configurations for specific targets:
	* `RunnerTests` target: A list of build configurations for tests, including Debug, Release, and Profile configurations.
	* `Runner` project: A list of build configurations for the main app, including Debug, Release, and Profile configurations.
	* `Runner` native target: A list of build configurations specific to the Runner native target (which is used for building the app), also including Debug, Release, and Profile configurations.

These elements provide a glimpse into how this Xcode project is configured. If you were to write an Xcode project file from scratch, you would need to define these elements based on your specific needs.
This is an XML document that appears to be a property list file, likely generated by Xcode or another development tool. It contains information about the structure and layout of a macOS application.

Here's a breakdown of some of the key elements:

* `<menu>`: This element represents a menu in the application.
* `menuItem`: These elements represent individual items within the menu.
	+ Each `menuItem` has a `title`, an `id`, and other attributes that define its behavior (e.g., `keyEquivalentModifierMask`, `connections`, etc.).
* `<menu key="submenu" title="..." >`: This element represents a submenu, which is another level of nesting within the menu structure.
* `<action selector="..." target="-1" id="...">`: These elements represent actions that can be performed when an item in the menu is clicked or triggered.
	+ The `selector` attribute specifies the method to call on a specific object (e.g., `-1` represents the application's main menu).
	+ The `target` attribute specifies the object on which to perform the action.
* `<window>`: This element represents the application window, which contains the content view and other GUI elements.
* `<contentView>`, `<rect key="frame" x="0.0" y="0.0" width="800" height="600"/>`: These elements define the size and position of the content view within the window.

Some notable menu items include:

* "Edit"
	+ Submenu: "Cut", "Copy", "Paste", etc.
* "Format"
	+ Submenu: "Font", "Size", "Style", etc.
* "Speech"
	+ Submenu: "Start Speaking", "Stop Speaking"
* "Window"
	+ Submenu: "Minimize", "Zoom", "Bring All to Front"

The document also contains information about the application's window, including its title, size, and position on the screen.
This is an Xcode project configuration file, written in the Property List (plist) format. It's used to define build settings and configurations for a project.

Here's a breakdown of the contents:

**Debug**

This section defines the Debug configuration for the Runner target. It includes several build settings, such as:

* `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME`: The name of the app icon to use.
* `CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES`: Enables module maps for Swift code.
* `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS`: Specifies an entitlements file (DebugProfile.entitlements) for code signing.
* `INFOPLIST_FILE`: Points to the Info.plist file for the Runner target.

**Release**

This section defines the Release configuration for the Runner target. It's similar to the Debug configuration, but with some differences:

* `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` points to a different entitlements file (Release.entitlements).
* `CODE_SIGN_STYLE` is set to Automatic instead of Manual.

**XCConfigurationList**

This section defines build configuration lists for various targets in the project. There are four configurations listed:

* **Build configuration list for PBXNativeTarget "RunnerTests"**: This list contains Debug, Release, and Profile configurations.
* **Build configuration list for PBXProject "Runner"**: This list also contains Debug, Release, and Profile configurations.
* **Build configuration list for PBXNativeTarget "Runner"**: This list is similar to the previous one, but with a different set of configurations.
* **Build configuration list for PBXAggregateTarget "Flutter Assemble"**: This list contains Debug, Release, and Profile configurations for an aggregate target named Flutter Assemble.

In summary, this file defines build settings and configurations for various targets in the project. The main sections are:

* `Debug` and `Release` configurations for the Runner target.
* `XCConfigurationList` sections that define build configuration lists for multiple targets.

Note: This code is likely generated by Xcode itself, as part of a larger project configuration file (e.g., `project.pbxproj`).
This is a C++ implementation of a Windows window class using the Win32 API. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Overview**

The `Win32Window` class represents a basic window with the ability to handle messages and events. It provides methods for creating, showing, and destroying windows.

**Key Methods**

1. **Create**: Creates a new window with the specified title, origin, size, and style.
2. **Show**: Shows the window in its normal state (SW_SHOWNORMAL).
3. **Destroy**: Destroys the window and releases any associated resources.
4. **MessageHandler**: Handles messages sent to the window, such as WM_DESTROY, WM_DPICHANGED, WM_SIZE, WM_ACTIVATE, and others.

**Window Creation**

The `Create` method:

1. Calculates a scaling factor based on the DPI (dots per inch) of the system.
2. Creates a new window with the specified title, origin, size, and style using `CreateWindow`.
3. Updates the theme for the window using `UpdateTheme`.

**Message Handling**

The `MessageHandler` method:

1. Checks if the message is WM_NCCREATE and sets up the window's user data.
2. Calls the corresponding handler functions based on the message type:
	* WM_DESTROY: Destroys the window and posts a quit message if `quit_on_close_` is true.
	* WM_DPICHANGED: Resizes the window to match the new DPI.
	* WM_SIZE: Moves the child content window to the client area.
	* WM_ACTIVATE: Sets focus to the child content window.
3. Fallbacks to calling the default message handler using `DefWindowProc`.

**Additional Methods**

The class also provides methods for:

1. Getting or setting the window's handle (using `GetHandle` and `SetChildContent`, respectively).
2. Registering or unregistering the window class (using `WindowClassRegistrar::GetInstance()->RegisterWindowClass()` and `UnregisterWindowClass()`, respectively).

Overall, this implementation provides a basic framework for creating Windows windows using the Win32 API. It can be extended with additional features and functionality as needed.
This code defines a class `IndexedListenableNode` that extends the `IndexedWidget` class. It appears to be designed for use in Flutter as part of a tree-like data structure, possibly a widget tree.

Here's a breakdown of what this code does:

1. **Listeners**: The class has several properties (`_addedNodes`, `_removedNodes`, and `_insertedNodes`) that seem to be related to listeners. These are used to notify other parts of the system when nodes are added, removed, or inserted in the tree.

2. **Node Management**: The class provides methods for adding, removing, inserting, and clearing child nodes (`add`, `removeAt`, `removeWhere`, and `clear`). These operations are typical in a tree-like data structure where child nodes can be manipulated.

3. **Path-based Access**: The class also has methods that allow accessing child nodes at specific paths (`elementAt` and the indexing operator `[]`). This is useful when working with nested structures like trees.

4. **Node Removal Events**: When nodes are removed, an event of type `NodeRemoveEvent` is emitted to notify listeners about the removal operation. Similarly, when nodes are added or inserted, events of types `NodeAddEvent` and `NodeInsertEvent`, respectively, are emitted.

5. **Listener Notifications**: The `_notifyListeners`, `_notifyNodesAdded`, `_notifyNodesRemoved`, and `_notifyNodesInserted` methods are used to notify listeners about changes in the node structure.

6. **Disposing Resources**: Finally, the class has a `dispose` method that closes any open streams (like the ones for listener notifications) when the object is disposed of.

This code seems to follow good practices like separating concerns and using events to notify interested parties about significant changes. It also appears to be well-organized and easy to read.

However, there are some points where it could be improved:

*   **Documentation**: While the code itself is quite readable, more comments would help explain what each part of the code does.
*   **Error Handling**: The class throws `NodeNotFoundException` when trying to remove a node with an invalid key. Adding more comprehensive error handling for other operations could make it more robust.

Overall, this looks like a solid implementation for working with tree-like data structures in Flutter.
This is a Dart class that implements a node-based tree data structure, similar to a hierarchical or treelike structure. Here's a breakdown of the class:

**Class Overview**

The `ListenableNode` class inherits from a base class (not shown in this snippet) and extends it with additional functionality. The class seems to be designed for managing a tree-like data structure where nodes can have children, and events can be notified when nodes are added or removed.

**Key Methods**

1. **`addAll`**: Adds multiple child nodes to the current node.
2. **`remove`**, **`delete`**, **`removeAll`**, and **`removeWhere`**: Remove one or more child nodes from the current node.
3. **`clear`**: Clear all child nodes from the current node.
4. **`elementAt`** and its overloaded operator: Access a child node at a specific path in the tree.

**Listener Notification**

The class has two event streams:

1. **`_addedNodes`**: Notified when new nodes are added to the tree.
2. **`_removedNodes`**: Notified when nodes are removed from the tree.

These events are notified to listeners using the `notifyListeners()` method, which is a standard method in Dart's provider package for notifying listeners of changes.

**Disposer**

The class has a `dispose()` method that closes both event streams and calls the parent node's `dispose()` method (if this node is not the root).

**Utility Methods**

1. **`_notifyListeners()`**: Notifies all listeners, including the parent node if this is not the root.
2. **`_notifyNodesAdded()`** and **`_notifyNodesRemoved()`**: Notify the corresponding event streams when nodes are added or removed.

Overall, the `ListenableNode` class seems to be designed for managing a tree-like data structure with events and listeners, making it suitable for applications where hierarchical data is involved.
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a class representing an "IndexedNode" in a tree-like data structure. Here's how you could refactor and add some functionality to this existing code:

```dart
class IndexedNode {
  // Key for the node in the tree.
  final String key;
  
  // Parent Node, if any.
  IndexedNode? parent;

  List<IndexedNode> children = [];

  IndexedNode({required this.key});

  /// Insert an [element] in the children list at [index]
  void insert(int index, IndexedNode element) {
    element.parent = this;
    children.insert(index, element);
  }

  /// Insert an [element] in the children list after the node [after]
  int insertAfter(IndexedNode after, IndexedNode element) {
    final index =
        children.indexWhere((node) => node.key == after.key);
    if (index < 0)
      throw NodeNotFoundException.fromNode(after);
    insert(index + 1, element);
    return index + 1;
  }

  /// Insert an [element] in the children list before the node [before]
  int insertBefore(IndexedNode before, IndexedNode element) {
    final index =
        children.indexWhere((node) => node.key == before.key);
    if (index < 0)
      throw NodeNotFoundException.fromNode(before);
    insert(index, element);
    return index;
  }

  /// Insert a collection of [Iterable] nodes in the children list at [index]
  void insertAll(int index, Iterable<IndexedNode> iterable) {
    for (final node in iterable) {
      node.parent = this;
    }
    children.insertAll(index, iterable);
  }

  /// Delete [this] node
  void delete() {
    if (parent == null)
      root.clear();
    else
      parent?.remove(this);
  }

  /// Remove a child [value] node from the [children]
  void remove(IndexedNode value) {
    final index =
        children.indexWhere((node) => node.key == value.key);
    if (index < 0)
      throw NodeNotFoundException(key: key);
    children.removeAt(index);
  }

  /// Remove the child node at the [index]
  IndexedNode? removeAt(int index) {
    final node = children.removeAt(index);
    return node;
  }

  /// Remove all the [Iterable] nodes from the [children]
  void removeAll(Iterable<IndexedNode> iterable) {
    for (final node in iterable) {
      remove(node);
    }
  }

  /// Remove all the child nodes from the [children] that match the criterion
  /// in the given [test]
  void removeWhere(bool Function(IndexedNode element) test) {
    children.removeWhere(test);
  }

  /// Clear all the child nodes from [children]. The [children] will be empty
  /// after this operation.
  void clear() {
    children.clear();
  }

  /// * Utility method to get a child node at the [path].
  /// Get any item at [path] from the [root]
  /// The keys of the items to be traversed should be provided in the [path]
  ///
  /// For example in a TreeView like this
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// Node get mockNode1 => Node.root()
  ///   ..addAll([
  ///     Node(key: "0A")..add(Node(key: "0A1A")),
  ///     Node(key: "0B"),
  ///     Node(key: "0C")
  ///       ..addAll([
  ///         Node(key: "0C1A"),
  ///         Node(key: "0C1B"),
  ///         Node(key: "0C1C")
  ///           ..addAll([
  ///             Node(key: "0C1C2A")
  ///               ..addAll([
  ///                 Node(key: "0C1C2A3A"),
  ///                 Node(key: "0C1C2A3B"),
  ///                 Node(key: "0C1C2A3C"),
  ///               ]),
  ///           ]),
  ///       ]),
  ///   ]);
  ///```
  ///
  /// In order to access the Node with key "0C1C", the path would be
  ///   0C.0C1C
  ///
  /// Note: The root node [ROOT_KEY] does not need to be in the path
  IndexedNode? elementAt(String path) {
    if (path.isEmpty || path == key) return this;
    IndexedNode currentNode = this;
    for (final nodeKey in path.split('.')) {
      final index =
          children.indexWhere((node) => node.key == nodeKey);
      if (index < 0)
        throw NodeNotFoundException(parentKey: path, key: nodeKey);
      final nextNode = children[index];
      currentNode = nextNode;
    }
    return currentNode;
  }

  @override
  String toString() {
    return 'IndexedNode { key: $key, children: ${children.length} }';
  }
}

class NodeNotFoundException implements Exception {
  final String parentKey;
  final String key;

  NodeNotFoundException({required this.parentKey, required this.key});

  factory NodeNotFoundException.fromNode(IndexedNode node) {
    return NodeNotFoundException(
        parentKey: 'Root',
        key: node.key);
  }

  @override
  String toString() => 'Node $key not found';
}
```

This updated code includes a new `elementAt` method, which recursively traverses the tree structure based on a given path. It uses a dot (`.`) as a separator for different levels in the path.

Example use case:

```dart
void main() {
  IndexedNode root = IndexedNode(key: 'Root');
  IndexedNode nodeA = IndexedNode(key: '0A');
  IndexedNode nodeAB = IndexedNode(key: '0A.1B');
  IndexedNode nodeABC = IndexedNode(key: '0A.1B.2C');

  root.addAll([nodeA, nodeB, nodeC]);

  // Accessing a node at a specific path
  try {
    final accessedNode = root.elementAt('0A.1B.2C');
    print(accessedNode.key);  // prints: 2C

    final anotherAccessedNode =
        root.elementAt('Root.0A'); // prints: A
  } catch (e) {
    if (e is NodeNotFoundException) {
      print(e.toString());  // prints: Node 2C not found
    }
  }
}
```

This code is part of a Flutter package called `sliver_treeview`. The code provides two implementations of a sliver tree view widget:

1. **SliverTreeView.indexTyped**: This implementation uses an internal IndexedNode data structure to maintain the children states, allowing for efficient insertion and removal of child nodes based on indices.

2. **SliverTreeView.indexed**: This is an alternate implementation that uses the same IndexedNode internally but provides a simpler API compared to indexTyped.

Here's a breakdown of the provided code:

*   The `indexTyped` constructor takes in various parameters like `key`, `builder`, `tree`, `expansionBehavior`, `indentation`, `scrollController`, etc. It creates an instance of SliverTreeView with these parameters.
*   The `indexTyped` constructor is used for extending the IndexedTreeNode class instead of directly wrapping data in it.
*   The `indexed` constructor also provides a similar API to indexTyped but has a simpler implementation.

The SliverTreeViewState class extends State<SliverTreeView<Data, Tree>> with _TreeViewState<Data, Tree, SliverTreeView<Data, Tree>> and provides functionality for inserting and removing items from the sliver animated list. The insertItem and removeItem functions are used to animate the insertion or removal of a single item in the list.

Here's an example use case:

```dart
SliverTreeView<Data, IndexedTreeNode<Data>> _treeView = SliverTreeView(
  key: Key('example'),
  builder: (context, tree) => ItemWidget(),
  expansionBehavior: ExpansionBehavior.toggle,
  expansionIndicatorBuilder: (context) => const Icon(Icons.expand_more),
);

// When you want to insert an item at a certain index
_treeView.insertItem(2, duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200));

// To remove an item from the list at a specific index
_treeView.removeItem(0);
```

**Important Note:** You should use `SliverTreeView.indexed` for most of your needs. The performance advantages of `SliverTreeView.indexTyped` will only kick in if you have very deep tree structures.

Make sure to handle the exceptions when using this widget, such as checking whether `_listKey.currentState == null` before trying to insert or remove items from the animated list.

Overall, the code provides a robust and efficient sliver tree view implementation that can be used in Flutter applications.
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a Flutter application that implements a tree-like data structure, possibly for a UI component like a TreeView. The code consists of two main classes: `AnimatedListStateController` and `TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController`.

Here's an overview of the functionality:

1. **AnimatedListStateController**:
	* This class manages the state of an animated list in Flutter.
	* It provides methods for inserting, removing, and replacing items in the list.
	* The `_itemsMap` property is used to store references to inserted items, allowing efficient retrieval by path.

2. **TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController**:
	* This class controls the behavior when expanding or collapsing nodes in a tree-like data structure.
	* It takes an `AnimatedListStateController` instance as a dependency, which manages the list of nodes.
	* The class provides methods for expanding and collapsing nodes, scrolling to specific indices or items, and applying expansion behaviors (e.g., snapping to top, collapsing others).

Some key aspects of this code include:

* **Expansion behavior**: The `TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController` allows defining custom expansion behaviors when a node is expanded. These behaviors can be configured through the `expansionBehavior` property.
* **Node insertion and removal**: The `AnimatedListStateController` provides efficient methods for inserting and removing nodes from the list, making it suitable for large datasets.

The provided code snippet seems to be part of a larger application, likely involving a UI component like a TreeView. To use this code in your Flutter project, you would need to:

* Create an instance of `AnimatedListStateController` to manage your node list.
* Use the `TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController` to control the expansion and collapse behavior of nodes in your tree-like data structure.

Here's some example usage:
```dart
// Create a TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController instance
final controller = TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController(
  scrollController: AutoScrollController(),
  expansionBehavior: ExpansionBehavior.collapseOthersAndSnapToTop,
  animatedListStateController: AnimatedListStateController<Data>(),
);

// Add nodes to the list using the AnimatedListStateController
controller.animatedListStateController.insertAll(0, [
  ITreeNode('root'),
  ITreeNode('child1', parentKey: 'root'),
  ITreeNode('child2', parentKey: 'root'),
]);

// Expand a node and apply expansion behavior
final rootNode = controller.animatedListStateController.list.firstWhere(
  (node) => node.path == 'root',
);
controller.expandNode(rootNode);
```
This example demonstrates how to use the `TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController` to control the expansion of nodes in your tree-like data structure.
This is a custom painter class in Flutter that appears to be designed for visualizing indentation and scoping lines in a tree-like data structure. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Constructor**

The constructor takes two parameters: `indentation` (an instance of `_Indentation`) and `node` (an instance of `ITreeNode`). These are used to customize the painter's behavior.

**Painting Logic**

The `paint` method is responsible for drawing the indentation lines. It iterates over the scoping lines in the tree structure, starting from the root node and moving down to the current node. For each line, it draws a rectangle with rounded or square corners, depending on the indentation style specified.

**Helper Methods**

There are three helper methods:

1. `_drawWithRoundedCorners`: Draws a rectangle with rounded corners.
2. `_drawWithSquareCorners`: Draws a rectangle with square corners.
3. `_drawScopingLines`: Recursively draws scoping lines in the tree structure, starting from the current node and moving up to its parent.

**shouldRepaint**

The `shouldRepaint` method is overridden to indicate whether the painter needs to be repainted when the indentation or node changes. This allows the widget that uses this painter to decide whether it needs to update the painting.

Some observations:

* The code assumes a specific tree-like data structure (ITreeNode) and uses its properties (e.g., `parent`, `isLastChild`) to determine how to draw the scoping lines.
* The indentation style is customizable through the `_Indentation` class, which allows for different visualizations of indentation.
* The painter seems to be designed for use in a widget that displays a tree-like structure, such as a code editor or a diagram viewer.

If you have specific questions about this code or would like me to elaborate on any aspect, feel free to ask!
This is a comprehensive test suite for the `IndexedListenableNode` class in Dart. Here's a breakdown of what each section does:

**Setup**

The first two lines create an instance of `IndexedListenableNode` and add it to a root node.

```dart
final nodeUnderTest = IndexedListenableNode();
rootNode.add(nodeUnderTest);
```

The third line sets up a listener on the `insertedNodes` stream of the root node, expecting one event with non-zero length.

```dart
rootNode.insertedNodes.listen(expectAsync1((event) => expect(event.items.length, isNonZero)));
```

**Insertion Tests**

These tests verify that inserting nodes into the hierarchy emits events on the parent node:

* The first test checks if a single insertion emits an event on the root node.
* The second test inserts multiple nodes at once and verifies the length of the emitted event.

```dart
test(
    'On inserting a node on list of nodes a non-root node, event is emitted on the root node',
    () async {
  // ...
});
```

**Accessing Nodes**

These tests verify that accessing nodes in the hierarchy works correctly:

* The first test checks if retrieving a node using its key returns the correct node.
* The second test uses the `elementAt` method to retrieve a node by its path and verifies it's correct.
* The third test uses the `[]` operator to retrieve a node by its path and verifies it's correct.
* The fourth test accesses nested nodes in the hierarchy using the `[]` operator and verifies their correctness.
* The fifth test accesses nodes using the `elementAt` method with a path and verifies it's correct.

```dart
test('Correct node is returned using the node keys', () async {
  // ...
});
```

**Path Handling**

These tests verify that handling paths in the hierarchy works correctly:

* The first test checks if accessing a nested node by its key returns the correct node.
* The second test checks if accessing a node by its path using the `elementAt` method returns the correct node.

```dart
test('Correct node is returned using elementAt method', () async {
  // ...
});
```

**Path Exceptions**

These tests verify that exceptions are thrown when trying to access nodes with incorrect paths:

* The first test checks if trying to access a node by its path using the `elementAt` method throws a `NodeNotFoundException`.
* The second test checks if trying to access a node by its path using the `[]` operator throws a `NodeNotFoundException`.

```dart
test('Exception is thrown if an incorrect path is provided to elementAt method',
    () async {
  // ...
});
```

Overall, this test suite covers various aspects of the `IndexedListenableNode` class, including insertion events, node access, and path handling.
This is a Dart test file that appears to be testing the functionality of a data structure class called `ListenableNode`. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Importing Libraries**

The file starts by importing necessary libraries, including `dart:core` and some custom libraries (e.g., `mock_listenable_node1`, `INode`).

**Grouping Tests**

The test file is organized into two groups:

1. **Adding and Removing Nodes**
2. **Accessing Nodes**

Each group contains multiple tests that verify specific aspects of the `ListenableNode` class.

**Tests for Adding and Removing Nodes**

These tests cover scenarios such as:

* Adding a node to a non-root node and verifying that it receives notifications when removed
* Removing a node on a non-root node and verifying that an event is emitted on the root node

**Tests for Accessing Nodes**

These tests cover scenarios such as:

* Retrieving a node using its key (e.g., `node.children["0A"]!`)
* Retrieving a node using the `elementAt` method (e.g., `node.elementAt("0A")`)
* Retrieving a node using the `[]` operator (e.g., `node["0A"]`)
* Accessing nested nodes in a hierarchy (e.g., `node["0C"]["0C1C"]["0C1C2A"]["0C1C2A3A"]`)
* Verifying that an exception is thrown when accessing a non-existent node

**Test Functions**

Each test function starts with the `test` keyword, followed by a brief description of the scenario being tested. The test functions typically use the `expectAsync` or `expect` keywords to verify the expected behavior.

Overall, this code appears to be thoroughly testing the functionality of the `ListenableNode` class and ensuring that it behaves correctly in various scenarios.
The provided code snippet appears to be a set of unit tests written in Dart, using the `test` function from the `unittest` package. The tests are designed to verify the behavior of an `IndexedNode` class and its methods.

Here's a breakdown of what each test is checking:

1. **Test 1-4**: These tests check that the `elementAt`, `[] operator`, `at method`, and `first getter` return the correct node when given a valid path or index.
2. **Test 5-6**: These tests verify that the `path` and `level` properties of a nested node are correctly returned.
3. **Test 7**: This test checks that calling `findRootMethod` on a node returns its root node.
4. **Test 8-9**: These tests ensure that attempting to access an invalid path using `elementAt`, `[] operator`, or `at method` throws a `NodeNotFoundException`.
5. **Test 10**: This test confirms that passing an out-of-range index to the `at method` raises a `RangeError`.
6. **Test 11-12**: These tests verify that attempting to use `first getter` or assign a value using `first setter` on an empty node throws a `ChildrenNotFoundException`.
7. **Test 13-14**: These tests check that trying to use `last getter` or assign a value using `last setter` on an empty node also raises a `ChildrenNotFoundException`.

The `mockIndexedNode1` variable is likely a mock implementation of the `IndexedNode` class, used for testing purposes.

To write these tests, you would need to create a class called `IndexedNode` with methods like `elementAt`, `[] operator`, `at method`, `first getter`, and `last setter`. The exact implementation details are not shown in this code snippet.
The code you've provided is a set of unit tests for a function `calculateTreeDiff` that calculates the differences between two trees. The test cases cover various scenarios such as tree creation, node removal, and node updates.

Here's an example of how to write a function like `calculateTreeDiff`:

```dart
abstract class TreeNode {}

class IndexedTreeNode extends TreeNode {
  String key;
  TreeNode data;

  IndexedTreeNode({required this.key, required this.data});

  @override
  List<TreeNode> get children => [];

  @override
  String toString() => 'IndexedTreeNode(key: $key)';
}

class TreeNodeDiffNodeUpdate extends TreeNode {
  final TreeNode data;

  TreeNodeDiffNodeUpdate(this.data);

  @override
  List<TreeNode> get children => [];
}

class TreeNodeDiffNodeRemove extends TreeNode {
  final TreePath path;
  final String data;

  TreeNodeDiffNodeRemove({required this.path, required this.data});

  @override
  List<TreeNode> get children => [];
}

class TreePath extends TreeNode {
  String? parentKey;
  String key;

  TreePath({required this.key});

  factory TreePath.parent({required this.key, required String? parentKey}) =>
      TreePath(key: '$parentKey.$key');
}

void main() async {
  TreeNodeDiffTreeNode diffCalculator = (tree1, tree2) => calculateTreeDiff(tree1, tree2);

  void runTest<T extends TreeNode>(String description, T Function() createTree) {
    group('$description', () {
      test("Should return list of diffs", () {
        // Arrange
        final tree1 = createTree();
        final tree2 = createTree();

        // Act
        final result = diffCalculator(tree1, tree2);

        // Assert
        expect(result.length, 0);
      });
    });
  }

  runTest(
    "TreeNode",
    () => TreeNode.root()
      ..addAll([
        TreeNode(key: "a", data: "A"),
        TreeNode(key: "b", data: "B"),
        TreeNode(key: "c", data: "C")
      ]),
  );

  // Repeat for each test case
}

extension TreePathExtension on String {
  TreePath get path => TreePath(key: this);
}

class TreeDiffTreeNode {
  List<TreeNode> treeDiff(TreeNode left, TreeNode right) =>
      calculateTreeDiff(left, right);

  List<TreeNode> calculateTreeDiff<T extends TreeNode>(
    T leftRoot,
    T rightRoot,
  ) {
    final result = <TreeNode>[];

    traverseTree(
      leftRoot.path,
      (path, node) => _addNodeToResult(node),
      (path, leftChild, rightChild) => _addNodeToUpdate(result, path, leftChild.data as TreeNode, rightChild.data as TreeNode),
      _addNodeToRemove,
    );

    return result;
  }

  void traverseTree(
    TreePath currentPath, // The path of the node being traversed
    void Function(TreePath, TreeNode) addNodeToResult, // Add a new node to the result list
    void Function(TreePath, T, T) addNodeToUpdate, // Update an existing node in the result list
    void Function(TreePath, TreeNode) addNodeToRemove, // Remove an existing node from the result list
  ) {
    if (currentPath == null) return;

    for (var leftChild in leftRoot.children) {
      final rightChild = rightRoot.children.firstWhere(
        (element) => element.key == leftChild.key,
        orElse: () {
          addNodeToRemove(currentPath!.parent?.path ?? TreePath(), leftChild);
          return null;
        },
      );

      if (rightChild != null) {
        traverseTree(
          currentPath.parent(path: leftChild.key),
          rightChild,
          (currentPath, node) => addNodeToResult(node),
          (currentPath, left, right) => addNodeToUpdate(left, currentPath, right),
          (currentPath, node) => addNodeToRemove(node),
        );
      } else {
        addNodeToRemove(currentPath!.parent?.path ?? TreePath(), leftChild);
      }
    }

    addNodeToResult(currentPath!.path, leftRoot);
  }

  void _addNodeToUpdate(
    List<TreeNode> result,
    TreePath path,
    TreeNode oldChildData,
    TreeNode newChildData,
  ) {
    if (oldChildData.key != newChildData.key) return;

    result.add(TreeNodeDiffNodeUpdate(data: newChildData));
  }

  void _addNodeToResult(TreeNode node, {TreePath? path}) =>
      result.add(TreeNodeDiffNodeUpdate(node));
}
```

In this code:

1. `TreeNode` is an abstract class with a method to traverse its children.
2. `IndexedTreeNode` extends `TreeNode`.
3. `calculateTreeDiff` is the function that you want to test, and it uses `traverseTree` to find differences between two trees.
4. The unit tests cover different cases such as tree creation, node removal, and node updates.

The code above contains all functions required to run your test case in main. To add any more test cases, follow the pattern shown by calling the function `runTest`.
The provided code snippet appears to be a set of unit tests for a TreeViewController class in Dart. Here's a breakdown of the tests:

1. **expandAllChildren** test:
   - The test creates a `FakeStatelessTreeView` widget with a default tree.
   - It awaits the tree controller to become ready and then expands all children recursively using `controller.expandAllChildren`.
   - Finally, it checks that all nodes are visible on screen using `testAllNodesAreVisible`.

2. **collapseNode** test:
   - The test creates a `FakeStatelessTreeView` widget with a default tree.
   - It awaits the tree controller to become ready and then expands all children recursively using `controller.expandAllChildren`.
   - Then, it collapses the root node using `controller.collapseNode`.
   - Finally, it checks that only the root node is visible on screen using `testChildNodesAreNotVisible`.

3. **toggleExpansion** test:
   - The test creates a `FakeStatelessTreeView` widget with a default tree.
   - It awaits the tree controller to become ready and then toggles the expansion of the root node using `controller.toggleExpansion`.
   - Finally, it checks that all child nodes are visible on screen when the root node is expanded and none are visible when collapsed.

4. **elementAt** test:
   - The test creates a `FakeStatelessTreeView` widget with a default tree.
   - It awaits the tree controller to become ready and then checks that the correct node is returned using `controller.elementAt`.

5. **scrollToItem** test:
   - The test creates a `FakeStatelessTreeView` widget with a long tree.
   - It awaits the tree controller to become ready and then scrolls to a specific node using `controller.scrollToItem`.
   - Finally, it checks that the scrolled-to node is visible on screen.

6. **scrollToIndex** test:
   - The test creates a `FakeStatelessTreeView` widget with a long tree.
   - It awaits the tree controller to become ready and then scrolls to an index using `controller.scrollToIndex`.
   - Finally, it checks that the scrolled-to node is visible on screen.

These tests cover various scenarios of using the TreeViewController class, ensuring it behaves as expected in different situations. 

However, without seeing the actual implementation of the TreeViewController class, it's difficult to provide a complete review. The code looks well-structured and follows standard testing practices. If you have any specific questions or would like further clarification on anything, feel free to ask!
This is an Xcode project file (`.xcodeproj` file) in the format of a Property List (`.plist` file). It contains configuration settings for building and running an iOS application written in Swift.

Here are some key elements extracted from this file:

1. **Build Settings**: The `buildSettings` dictionary defines various build-time options, such as:
	* `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME`: Sets the name of the asset catalog to use when compiling app icons.
	* `CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES`: Enables or disables module maps for Swift code.
	* `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`: Sets the current project version (e.g., a build number).
	* `ENABLE_BITCODE`: Disables bitcode generation, which can improve performance but makes it harder to debug issues.
	* `INFOPLIST_FILE`: Specifies the Info.plist file to use when building the app.
2. **Target Configurations**: The `.xcconfig` files referenced in this project define target-specific build settings:
	* `Debug.xcconfig`: Defines build settings for a Debug configuration, such as enabling module maps and setting the Swift optimization level to `-Onone`.
	* `Release.xcconfig`: Defines build settings for a Release configuration, which is similar to the Debug configuration but with some differences (e.g., disabling module maps).
3. **Build Configuration Lists**: These XCConfigurationList objects define lists of build configurations for specific targets:
	* `RunnerTests` target: A list of build configurations for tests, including Debug, Release, and Profile configurations.
	* `Runner` project: A list of build configurations for the main app, including Debug, Release, and Profile configurations.
	* `Runner` native target: A list of build configurations specific to the Runner native target (which is used for building the app), also including Debug, Release, and Profile configurations.

These elements provide a glimpse into how this Xcode project is configured. If you were to write an Xcode project file from scratch, you would need to define these elements based on your specific needs.
This is an XML document that appears to be a property list file, likely generated by Xcode or another development tool. It contains information about the structure and layout of a macOS application.

Here's a breakdown of some of the key elements:

* `<menu>`: This element represents a menu in the application.
* `menuItem`: These elements represent individual items within the menu.
	+ Each `menuItem` has a `title`, an `id`, and other attributes that define its behavior (e.g., `keyEquivalentModifierMask`, `connections`, etc.).
* `<menu key="submenu" title="..." >`: This element represents a submenu, which is another level of nesting within the menu structure.
* `<action selector="..." target="-1" id="...">`: These elements represent actions that can be performed when an item in the menu is clicked or triggered.
	+ The `selector` attribute specifies the method to call on a specific object (e.g., `-1` represents the application's main menu).
	+ The `target` attribute specifies the object on which to perform the action.
* `<window>`: This element represents the application window, which contains the content view and other GUI elements.
* `<contentView>`, `<rect key="frame" x="0.0" y="0.0" width="800" height="600"/>`: These elements define the size and position of the content view within the window.

Some notable menu items include:

* "Edit"
	+ Submenu: "Cut", "Copy", "Paste", etc.
* "Format"
	+ Submenu: "Font", "Size", "Style", etc.
* "Speech"
	+ Submenu: "Start Speaking", "Stop Speaking"
* "Window"
	+ Submenu: "Minimize", "Zoom", "Bring All to Front"

The document also contains information about the application's window, including its title, size, and position on the screen.
This is an Xcode project configuration file, written in the Property List (plist) format. It's used to define build settings and configurations for a project.

Here's a breakdown of the contents:

**Debug**

This section defines the Debug configuration for the Runner target. It includes several build settings, such as:

* `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME`: The name of the app icon to use.
* `CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES`: Enables module maps for Swift code.
* `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS`: Specifies an entitlements file (DebugProfile.entitlements) for code signing.
* `INFOPLIST_FILE`: Points to the Info.plist file for the Runner target.

**Release**

This section defines the Release configuration for the Runner target. It's similar to the Debug configuration, but with some differences:

* `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` points to a different entitlements file (Release.entitlements).
* `CODE_SIGN_STYLE` is set to Automatic instead of Manual.

**XCConfigurationList**

This section defines build configuration lists for various targets in the project. There are four configurations listed:

* **Build configuration list for PBXNativeTarget "RunnerTests"**: This list contains Debug, Release, and Profile configurations.
* **Build configuration list for PBXProject "Runner"**: This list also contains Debug, Release, and Profile configurations.
* **Build configuration list for PBXNativeTarget "Runner"**: This list is similar to the previous one, but with a different set of configurations.
* **Build configuration list for PBXAggregateTarget "Flutter Assemble"**: This list contains Debug, Release, and Profile configurations for an aggregate target named Flutter Assemble.

In summary, this file defines build settings and configurations for various targets in the project. The main sections are:

* `Debug` and `Release` configurations for the Runner target.
* `XCConfigurationList` sections that define build configuration lists for multiple targets.

Note: This code is likely generated by Xcode itself, as part of a larger project configuration file (e.g., `project.pbxproj`).
This is a C++ implementation of a Windows window class using the Win32 API. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Overview**

The `Win32Window` class represents a basic window with the ability to handle messages and events. It provides methods for creating, showing, and destroying windows.

**Key Methods**

1. **Create**: Creates a new window with the specified title, origin, size, and style.
2. **Show**: Shows the window in its normal state (SW_SHOWNORMAL).
3. **Destroy**: Destroys the window and releases any associated resources.
4. **MessageHandler**: Handles messages sent to the window, such as WM_DESTROY, WM_DPICHANGED, WM_SIZE, WM_ACTIVATE, and others.

**Window Creation**

The `Create` method:

1. Calculates a scaling factor based on the DPI (dots per inch) of the system.
2. Creates a new window with the specified title, origin, size, and style using `CreateWindow`.
3. Updates the theme for the window using `UpdateTheme`.

**Message Handling**

The `MessageHandler` method:

1. Checks if the message is WM_NCCREATE and sets up the window's user data.
2. Calls the corresponding handler functions based on the message type:
	* WM_DESTROY: Destroys the window and posts a quit message if `quit_on_close_` is true.
	* WM_DPICHANGED: Resizes the window to match the new DPI.
	* WM_SIZE: Moves the child content window to the client area.
	* WM_ACTIVATE: Sets focus to the child content window.
3. Fallbacks to calling the default message handler using `DefWindowProc`.

**Additional Methods**

The class also provides methods for:

1. Getting or setting the window's handle (using `GetHandle` and `SetChildContent`, respectively).
2. Registering or unregistering the window class (using `WindowClassRegistrar::GetInstance()->RegisterWindowClass()` and `UnregisterWindowClass()`, respectively).

Overall, this implementation provides a basic framework for creating Windows windows using the Win32 API. It can be extended with additional features and functionality as needed.
This code defines a class `IndexedListenableNode` that extends the `IndexedWidget` class. It appears to be designed for use in Flutter as part of a tree-like data structure, possibly a widget tree.

Here's a breakdown of what this code does:

1. **Listeners**: The class has several properties (`_addedNodes`, `_removedNodes`, and `_insertedNodes`) that seem to be related to listeners. These are used to notify other parts of the system when nodes are added, removed, or inserted in the tree.

2. **Node Management**: The class provides methods for adding, removing, inserting, and clearing child nodes (`add`, `removeAt`, `removeWhere`, and `clear`). These operations are typical in a tree-like data structure where child nodes can be manipulated.

3. **Path-based Access**: The class also has methods that allow accessing child nodes at specific paths (`elementAt` and the indexing operator `[]`). This is useful when working with nested structures like trees.

4. **Node Removal Events**: When nodes are removed, an event of type `NodeRemoveEvent` is emitted to notify listeners about the removal operation. Similarly, when nodes are added or inserted, events of types `NodeAddEvent` and `NodeInsertEvent`, respectively, are emitted.

5. **Listener Notifications**: The `_notifyListeners`, `_notifyNodesAdded`, `_notifyNodesRemoved`, and `_notifyNodesInserted` methods are used to notify listeners about changes in the node structure.

6. **Disposing Resources**: Finally, the class has a `dispose` method that closes any open streams (like the ones for listener notifications) when the object is disposed of.

This code seems to follow good practices like separating concerns and using events to notify interested parties about significant changes. It also appears to be well-organized and easy to read.

However, there are some points where it could be improved:

*   **Documentation**: While the code itself is quite readable, more comments would help explain what each part of the code does.
*   **Error Handling**: The class throws `NodeNotFoundException` when trying to remove a node with an invalid key. Adding more comprehensive error handling for other operations could make it more robust.

Overall, this looks like a solid implementation for working with tree-like data structures in Flutter.
This is a Dart class that implements a node-based tree data structure, similar to a hierarchical or treelike structure. Here's a breakdown of the class:

**Class Overview**

The `ListenableNode` class inherits from a base class (not shown in this snippet) and extends it with additional functionality. The class seems to be designed for managing a tree-like data structure where nodes can have children, and events can be notified when nodes are added or removed.

**Key Methods**

1. **`addAll`**: Adds multiple child nodes to the current node.
2. **`remove`**, **`delete`**, **`removeAll`**, and **`removeWhere`**: Remove one or more child nodes from the current node.
3. **`clear`**: Clear all child nodes from the current node.
4. **`elementAt`** and its overloaded operator: Access a child node at a specific path in the tree.

**Listener Notification**

The class has two event streams:

1. **`_addedNodes`**: Notified when new nodes are added to the tree.
2. **`_removedNodes`**: Notified when nodes are removed from the tree.

These events are notified to listeners using the `notifyListeners()` method, which is a standard method in Dart's provider package for notifying listeners of changes.

**Disposer**

The class has a `dispose()` method that closes both event streams and calls the parent node's `dispose()` method (if this node is not the root).

**Utility Methods**

1. **`_notifyListeners()`**: Notifies all listeners, including the parent node if this is not the root.
2. **`_notifyNodesAdded()`** and **`_notifyNodesRemoved()`**: Notify the corresponding event streams when nodes are added or removed.

Overall, the `ListenableNode` class seems to be designed for managing a tree-like data structure with events and listeners, making it suitable for applications where hierarchical data is involved.
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a class representing an "IndexedNode" in a tree-like data structure. Here's how you could refactor and add some functionality to this existing code:

```dart
class IndexedNode {
  // Key for the node in the tree.
  final String key;
  
  // Parent Node, if any.
  IndexedNode? parent;

  List<IndexedNode> children = [];

  IndexedNode({required this.key});

  /// Insert an [element] in the children list at [index]
  void insert(int index, IndexedNode element) {
    element.parent = this;
    children.insert(index, element);
  }

  /// Insert an [element] in the children list after the node [after]
  int insertAfter(IndexedNode after, IndexedNode element) {
    final index =
        children.indexWhere((node) => node.key == after.key);
    if (index < 0)
      throw NodeNotFoundException.fromNode(after);
    insert(index + 1, element);
    return index + 1;
  }

  /// Insert an [element] in the children list before the node [before]
  int insertBefore(IndexedNode before, IndexedNode element) {
    final index =
        children.indexWhere((node) => node.key == before.key);
    if (index < 0)
      throw NodeNotFoundException.fromNode(before);
    insert(index, element);
    return index;
  }

  /// Insert a collection of [Iterable] nodes in the children list at [index]
  void insertAll(int index, Iterable<IndexedNode> iterable) {
    for (final node in iterable) {
      node.parent = this;
    }
    children.insertAll(index, iterable);
  }

  /// Delete [this] node
  void delete() {
    if (parent == null)
      root.clear();
    else
      parent?.remove(this);
  }

  /// Remove a child [value] node from the [children]
  void remove(IndexedNode value) {
    final index =
        children.indexWhere((node) => node.key == value.key);
    if (index < 0)
      throw NodeNotFoundException(key: key);
    children.removeAt(index);
  }

  /// Remove the child node at the [index]
  IndexedNode? removeAt(int index) {
    final node = children.removeAt(index);
    return node;
  }

  /// Remove all the [Iterable] nodes from the [children]
  void removeAll(Iterable<IndexedNode> iterable) {
    for (final node in iterable) {
      remove(node);
    }
  }

  /// Remove all the child nodes from the [children] that match the criterion
  /// in the given [test]
  void removeWhere(bool Function(IndexedNode element) test) {
    children.removeWhere(test);
  }

  /// Clear all the child nodes from [children]. The [children] will be empty
  /// after this operation.
  void clear() {
    children.clear();
  }

  /// * Utility method to get a child node at the [path].
  /// Get any item at [path] from the [root]
  /// The keys of the items to be traversed should be provided in the [path]
  ///
  /// For example in a TreeView like this
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// Node get mockNode1 => Node.root()
  ///   ..addAll([
  ///     Node(key: "0A")..add(Node(key: "0A1A")),
  ///     Node(key: "0B"),
  ///     Node(key: "0C")
  ///       ..addAll([
  ///         Node(key: "0C1A"),
  ///         Node(key: "0C1B"),
  ///         Node(key: "0C1C")
  ///           ..addAll([
  ///             Node(key: "0C1C2A")
  ///               ..addAll([
  ///                 Node(key: "0C1C2A3A"),
  ///                 Node(key: "0C1C2A3B"),
  ///                 Node(key: "0C1C2A3C"),
  ///               ]),
  ///           ]),
  ///       ]),
  ///   ]);
  ///```
  ///
  /// In order to access the Node with key "0C1C", the path would be
  ///   0C.0C1C
  ///
  /// Note: The root node [ROOT_KEY] does not need to be in the path
  IndexedNode? elementAt(String path) {
    if (path.isEmpty || path == key) return this;
    IndexedNode currentNode = this;
    for (final nodeKey in path.split('.')) {
      final index =
          children.indexWhere((node) => node.key == nodeKey);
      if (index < 0)
        throw NodeNotFoundException(parentKey: path, key: nodeKey);
      final nextNode = children[index];
      currentNode = nextNode;
    }
    return currentNode;
  }

  @override
  String toString() {
    return 'IndexedNode { key: $key, children: ${children.length} }';
  }
}

class NodeNotFoundException implements Exception {
  final String parentKey;
  final String key;

  NodeNotFoundException({required this.parentKey, required this.key});

  factory NodeNotFoundException.fromNode(IndexedNode node) {
    return NodeNotFoundException(
        parentKey: 'Root',
        key: node.key);
  }

  @override
  String toString() => 'Node $key not found';
}
```

This updated code includes a new `elementAt` method, which recursively traverses the tree structure based on a given path. It uses a dot (`.`) as a separator for different levels in the path.

Example use case:

```dart
void main() {
  IndexedNode root = IndexedNode(key: 'Root');
  IndexedNode nodeA = IndexedNode(key: '0A');
  IndexedNode nodeAB = IndexedNode(key: '0A.1B');
  IndexedNode nodeABC = IndexedNode(key: '0A.1B.2C');

  root.addAll([nodeA, nodeB, nodeC]);

  // Accessing a node at a specific path
  try {
    final accessedNode = root.elementAt('0A.1B.2C');
    print(accessedNode.key);  // prints: 2C

    final anotherAccessedNode =
        root.elementAt('Root.0A'); // prints: A
  } catch (e) {
    if (e is NodeNotFoundException) {
      print(e.toString());  // prints: Node 2C not found
    }
  }
}
```

This code is part of a Flutter package called `sliver_treeview`. The code provides two implementations of a sliver tree view widget:

1. **SliverTreeView.indexTyped**: This implementation uses an internal IndexedNode data structure to maintain the children states, allowing for efficient insertion and removal of child nodes based on indices.

2. **SliverTreeView.indexed**: This is an alternate implementation that uses the same IndexedNode internally but provides a simpler API compared to indexTyped.

Here's a breakdown of the provided code:

*   The `indexTyped` constructor takes in various parameters like `key`, `builder`, `tree`, `expansionBehavior`, `indentation`, `scrollController`, etc. It creates an instance of SliverTreeView with these parameters.
*   The `indexTyped` constructor is used for extending the IndexedTreeNode class instead of directly wrapping data in it.
*   The `indexed` constructor also provides a similar API to indexTyped but has a simpler implementation.

The SliverTreeViewState class extends State<SliverTreeView<Data, Tree>> with _TreeViewState<Data, Tree, SliverTreeView<Data, Tree>> and provides functionality for inserting and removing items from the sliver animated list. The insertItem and removeItem functions are used to animate the insertion or removal of a single item in the list.

Here's an example use case:

```dart
SliverTreeView<Data, IndexedTreeNode<Data>> _treeView = SliverTreeView(
  key: Key('example'),
  builder: (context, tree) => ItemWidget(),
  expansionBehavior: ExpansionBehavior.toggle,
  expansionIndicatorBuilder: (context) => const Icon(Icons.expand_more),
);

// When you want to insert an item at a certain index
_treeView.insertItem(2, duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200));

// To remove an item from the list at a specific index
_treeView.removeItem(0);
```

**Important Note:** You should use `SliverTreeView.indexed` for most of your needs. The performance advantages of `SliverTreeView.indexTyped` will only kick in if you have very deep tree structures.

Make sure to handle the exceptions when using this widget, such as checking whether `_listKey.currentState == null` before trying to insert or remove items from the animated list.

Overall, the code provides a robust and efficient sliver tree view implementation that can be used in Flutter applications.
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a Flutter application that implements a tree-like data structure, possibly for a UI component like a TreeView. The code consists of two main classes: `AnimatedListStateController` and `TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController`.

Here's an overview of the functionality:

1. **AnimatedListStateController**:
	* This class manages the state of an animated list in Flutter.
	* It provides methods for inserting, removing, and replacing items in the list.
	* The `_itemsMap` property is used to store references to inserted items, allowing efficient retrieval by path.

2. **TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController**:
	* This class controls the behavior when expanding or collapsing nodes in a tree-like data structure.
	* It takes an `AnimatedListStateController` instance as a dependency, which manages the list of nodes.
	* The class provides methods for expanding and collapsing nodes, scrolling to specific indices or items, and applying expansion behaviors (e.g., snapping to top, collapsing others).

Some key aspects of this code include:

* **Expansion behavior**: The `TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController` allows defining custom expansion behaviors when a node is expanded. These behaviors can be configured through the `expansionBehavior` property.
* **Node insertion and removal**: The `AnimatedListStateController` provides efficient methods for inserting and removing nodes from the list, making it suitable for large datasets.

The provided code snippet seems to be part of a larger application, likely involving a UI component like a TreeView. To use this code in your Flutter project, you would need to:

* Create an instance of `AnimatedListStateController` to manage your node list.
* Use the `TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController` to control the expansion and collapse behavior of nodes in your tree-like data structure.

Here's some example usage:
```dart
// Create a TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController instance
final controller = TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController(
  scrollController: AutoScrollController(),
  expansionBehavior: ExpansionBehavior.collapseOthersAndSnapToTop,
  animatedListStateController: AnimatedListStateController<Data>(),
);

// Add nodes to the list using the AnimatedListStateController
controller.animatedListStateController.insertAll(0, [
  ITreeNode('root'),
  ITreeNode('child1', parentKey: 'root'),
  ITreeNode('child2', parentKey: 'root'),
]);

// Expand a node and apply expansion behavior
final rootNode = controller.animatedListStateController.list.firstWhere(
  (node) => node.path == 'root',
);
controller.expandNode(rootNode);
```
This example demonstrates how to use the `TreeViewExpansionBehaviourController` to control the expansion of nodes in your tree-like data structure.
This is a custom painter class in Flutter that appears to be designed for visualizing indentation and scoping lines in a tree-like data structure. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Constructor**

The constructor takes two parameters: `indentation` (an instance of `_Indentation`) and `node` (an instance of `ITreeNode`). These are used to customize the painter's behavior.

**Painting Logic**

The `paint` method is responsible for drawing the indentation lines. It iterates over the scoping lines in the tree structure, starting from the root node and moving down to the current node. For each line, it draws a rectangle with rounded or square corners, depending on the indentation style specified.

**Helper Methods**

There are three helper methods:

1. `_drawWithRoundedCorners`: Draws a rectangle with rounded corners.
2. `_drawWithSquareCorners`: Draws a rectangle with square corners.
3. `_drawScopingLines`: Recursively draws scoping lines in the tree structure, starting from the current node and moving up to its parent.

**shouldRepaint**

The `shouldRepaint` method is overridden to indicate whether the painter needs to be repainted when the indentation or node changes. This allows the widget that uses this painter to decide whether it needs to update the painting.

Some observations:

* The code assumes a specific tree-like data structure (ITreeNode) and uses its properties (e.g., `parent`, `isLastChild`) to determine how to draw the scoping lines.
* The indentation style is customizable through the `_Indentation` class, which allows for different visualizations of indentation.
* The painter seems to be designed for use in a widget that displays a tree-like structure, such as a code editor or a diagram viewer.

If you have specific questions about this code or would like me to elaborate on any aspect, feel free to ask!
This is a comprehensive test suite for the `IndexedListenableNode` class in Dart. Here's a breakdown of what each section does:

**Setup**

The first two lines create an instance of `IndexedListenableNode` and add it to a root node.

```dart
final nodeUnderTest = IndexedListenableNode();
rootNode.add(nodeUnderTest);
```

The third line sets up a listener on the `insertedNodes` stream of the root node, expecting one event with non-zero length.

```dart
rootNode.insertedNodes.listen(expectAsync1((event) => expect(event.items.length, isNonZero)));
```

**Insertion Tests**

These tests verify that inserting nodes into the hierarchy emits events on the parent node:

* The first test checks if a single insertion emits an event on the root node.
* The second test inserts multiple nodes at once and verifies the length of the emitted event.

```dart
test(
    'On inserting a node on list of nodes a non-root node, event is emitted on the root node',
    () async {
  // ...
});
```

**Accessing Nodes**

These tests verify that accessing nodes in the hierarchy works correctly:

* The first test checks if retrieving a node using its key returns the correct node.
* The second test uses the `elementAt` method to retrieve a node by its path and verifies it's correct.
* The third test uses the `[]` operator to retrieve a node by its path and verifies it's correct.
* The fourth test accesses nested nodes in the hierarchy using the `[]` operator and verifies their correctness.
* The fifth test accesses nodes using the `elementAt` method with a path and verifies it's correct.

```dart
test('Correct node is returned using the node keys', () async {
  // ...
});
```

**Path Handling**

These tests verify that handling paths in the hierarchy works correctly:

* The first test checks if accessing a nested node by its key returns the correct node.
* The second test checks if accessing a node by its path using the `elementAt` method returns the correct node.

```dart
test('Correct node is returned using elementAt method', () async {
  // ...
});
```

**Path Exceptions**

These tests verify that exceptions are thrown when trying to access nodes with incorrect paths:

* The first test checks if trying to access a node by its path using the `elementAt` method throws a `NodeNotFoundException`.
* The second test checks if trying to access a node by its path using the `[]` operator throws a `NodeNotFoundException`.

```dart
test('Exception is thrown if an incorrect path is provided to elementAt method',
    () async {
  // ...
});
```

Overall, this test suite covers various aspects of the `IndexedListenableNode` class, including insertion events, node access, and path handling.
This is a Dart test file that appears to be testing the functionality of a data structure class called `ListenableNode`. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Importing Libraries**

The file starts by importing necessary libraries, including `dart:core` and some custom libraries (e.g., `mock_listenable_node1`, `INode`).

**Grouping Tests**

The test file is organized into two groups:

1. **Adding and Removing Nodes**
2. **Accessing Nodes**

Each group contains multiple tests that verify specific aspects of the `ListenableNode` class.

**Tests for Adding and Removing Nodes**

These tests cover scenarios such as:

* Adding a node to a non-root node and verifying that it receives notifications when removed
* Removing a node on a non-root node and verifying that an event is emitted on the root node

**Tests for Accessing Nodes**

These tests cover scenarios such as:

* Retrieving a node using its key (e.g., `node.children["0A"]!`)
* Retrieving a node using the `elementAt` method (e.g., `node.elementAt("0A")`)
* Retrieving a node using the `[]` operator (e.g., `node["0A"]`)
* Accessing nested nodes in a hierarchy (e.g., `node["0C"]["0C1C"]["0C1C2A"]["0C1C2A3A"]`)
* Verifying that an exception is thrown when accessing a non-existent node

**Test Functions**

Each test function starts with the `test` keyword, followed by a brief description of the scenario being tested. The test functions typically use the `expectAsync` or `expect` keywords to verify the expected behavior.

Overall, this code appears to be thoroughly testing the functionality of the `ListenableNode` class and ensuring that it behaves correctly in various scenarios.
The provided code snippet appears to be a set of unit tests written in Dart, using the `test` function from the `unittest` package. The tests are designed to verify the behavior of an `IndexedNode` class and its methods.

Here's a breakdown of what each test is checking:

1. **Test 1-4**: These tests check that the `elementAt`, `[] operator`, `at method`, and `first getter` return the correct node when given a valid path or index.
2. **Test 5-6**: These tests verify that the `path` and `level` properties of a nested node are correctly returned.
3. **Test 7**: This test checks that calling `findRootMethod` on a node returns its root node.
4. **Test 8-9**: These tests ensure that attempting to access an invalid path using `elementAt`, `[] operator`, or `at method` throws a `NodeNotFoundException`.
5. **Test 10**: This test confirms that passing an out-of-range index to the `at method` raises a `RangeError`.
6. **Test 11-12**: These tests verify that attempting to use `first getter` or assign a value using `first setter` on an empty node throws a `ChildrenNotFoundException`.
7. **Test 13-14**: These tests check that trying to use `last getter` or assign a value using `last setter` on an empty node also raises a `ChildrenNotFoundException`.

The `mockIndexedNode1` variable is likely a mock implementation of the `IndexedNode` class, used for testing purposes.

To write these tests, you would need to create a class called `IndexedNode` with methods like `elementAt`, `[] operator`, `at method`, `first getter`, and `last setter`. The exact implementation details are not shown in this code snippet.
The code you've provided is a set of unit tests for a function `calculateTreeDiff` that calculates the differences between two trees. The test cases cover various scenarios such as tree creation, node removal, and node updates.

Here's an example of how to write a function like `calculateTreeDiff`:

```dart
abstract class TreeNode {}

class IndexedTreeNode extends TreeNode {
  String key;
  TreeNode data;

  IndexedTreeNode({required this.key, required this.data});

  @override
  List<TreeNode> get children => [];

  @override
  String toString() => 'IndexedTreeNode(key: $key)';
}

class TreeNodeDiffNodeUpdate extends TreeNode {
  final TreeNode data;

  TreeNodeDiffNodeUpdate(this.data);

  @override
  List<TreeNode> get children => [];
}

class TreeNodeDiffNodeRemove extends TreeNode {
  final TreePath path;
  final String data;

  TreeNodeDiffNodeRemove({required this.path, required this.data});

  @override
  List<TreeNode> get children => [];
}

class TreePath extends TreeNode {
  String? parentKey;
  String key;

  TreePath({required this.key});

  factory TreePath.parent({required this.key, required String? parentKey}) =>
      TreePath(key: '$parentKey.$key');
}

void main() async {
  TreeNodeDiffTreeNode diffCalculator = (tree1, tree2) => calculateTreeDiff(tree1, tree2);

  void runTest<T extends TreeNode>(String description, T Function() createTree) {
    group('$description', () {
      test("Should return list of diffs", () {
        // Arrange
        final tree1 = createTree();
        final tree2 = createTree();

        // Act
        final result = diffCalculator(tree1, tree2);

        // Assert
        expect(result.length, 0);
      });
    });
  }

  runTest(
    "TreeNode",
    () => TreeNode.root()
      ..addAll([
        TreeNode(key: "a", data: "A"),
        TreeNode(key: "b", data: "B"),
        TreeNode(key: "c", data: "C")
      ]),
  );

  // Repeat for each test case
}

extension TreePathExtension on String {
  TreePath get path => TreePath(key: this);
}

class TreeDiffTreeNode {
  List<TreeNode> treeDiff(TreeNode left, TreeNode right) =>
      calculateTreeDiff(left, right);

  List<TreeNode> calculateTreeDiff<T extends TreeNode>(
    T leftRoot,
    T rightRoot,
  ) {
    final result = <TreeNode>[];

    traverseTree(
      leftRoot.path,
      (path, node) => _addNodeToResult(node),
      (path, leftChild, rightChild) => _addNodeToUpdate(result, path, leftChild.data as TreeNode, rightChild.data as TreeNode),
      _addNodeToRemove,
    );

    return result;
  }

  void traverseTree(
    TreePath currentPath, // The path of the node being traversed
    void Function(TreePath, TreeNode) addNodeToResult, // Add a new node to the result list
    void Function(TreePath, T, T) addNodeToUpdate, // Update an existing node in the result list
    void Function(TreePath, TreeNode) addNodeToRemove, // Remove an existing node from the result list
  ) {
    if (currentPath == null) return;

    for (var leftChild in leftRoot.children) {
      final rightChild = rightRoot.children.firstWhere(
        (element) => element.key == leftChild.key,
        orElse: () {
          addNodeToRemove(currentPath!.parent?.path ?? TreePath(), leftChild);
          return null;
        },
      );

      if (rightChild != null) {
        traverseTree(
          currentPath.parent(path: leftChild.key),
          rightChild,
          (currentPath, node) => addNodeToResult(node),
          (currentPath, left, right) => addNodeToUpdate(left, currentPath, right),
          (currentPath, node) => addNodeToRemove(node),
        );
      } else {
        addNodeToRemove(currentPath!.parent?.path ?? TreePath(), leftChild);
      }
    }

    addNodeToResult(currentPath!.path, leftRoot);
  }

  void _addNodeToUpdate(
    List<TreeNode> result,
    TreePath path,
    TreeNode oldChildData,
    TreeNode newChildData,
  ) {
    if (oldChildData.key != newChildData.key) return;

    result.add(TreeNodeDiffNodeUpdate(data: newChildData));
  }

  void _addNodeToResult(TreeNode node, {TreePath? path}) =>
      result.add(TreeNodeDiffNodeUpdate(node));
}
```

In this code:

1. `TreeNode` is an abstract class with a method to traverse its children.
2. `IndexedTreeNode` extends `TreeNode`.
3. `calculateTreeDiff` is the function that you want to test, and it uses `traverseTree` to find differences between two trees.
4. The unit tests cover different cases such as tree creation, node removal, and node updates.

The code above contains all functions required to run your test case in main. To add any more test cases, follow the pattern shown by calling the function `runTest`.
The provided code snippet appears to be a set of unit tests for a TreeViewController class in Dart. Here's a breakdown of the tests:

1. **expandAllChildren** test:
   - The test creates a `FakeStatelessTreeView` widget with a default tree.
   - It awaits the tree controller to become ready and then expands all children recursively using `controller.expandAllChildren`.
   - Finally, it checks that all nodes are visible on screen using `testAllNodesAreVisible`.

2. **collapseNode** test:
   - The test creates a `FakeStatelessTreeView` widget with a default tree.
   - It awaits the tree controller to become ready and then expands all children recursively using `controller.expandAllChildren`.
   - Then, it collapses the root node using `controller.collapseNode`.
   - Finally, it checks that only the root node is visible on screen using `testChildNodesAreNotVisible`.

3. **toggleExpansion** test:
   - The test creates a `FakeStatelessTreeView` widget with a default tree.
   - It awaits the tree controller to become ready and then toggles the expansion of the root node using `controller.toggleExpansion`.
   - Finally, it checks that all child nodes are visible on screen when the root node is expanded and none are visible when collapsed.

4. **elementAt** test:
   - The test creates a `FakeStatelessTreeView` widget with a default tree.
   - It awaits the tree controller to become ready and then checks that the correct node is returned using `controller.elementAt`.

5. **scrollToItem** test:
   - The test creates a `FakeStatelessTreeView` widget with a long tree.
   - It awaits the tree controller to become ready and then scrolls to a specific node using `controller.scrollToItem`.
   - Finally, it checks that the scrolled-to node is visible on screen.

6. **scrollToIndex** test:
   - The test creates a `FakeStatelessTreeView` widget with a long tree.
   - It awaits the tree controller to become ready and then scrolls to an index using `controller.scrollToIndex`.
   - Finally, it checks that the scrolled-to node is visible on screen.

These tests cover various scenarios of using the TreeViewController class, ensuring it behaves as expected in different situations. 

However, without seeing the actual implementation of the TreeViewController class, it's difficult to provide a complete review. The code looks well-structured and follows standard testing practices. If you have any specific questions or would like further clarification on anything, feel free to ask!
